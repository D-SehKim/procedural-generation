# Procedural Generation
Welcome to the Procedural Generation repository! This project showcases a simple procedural generation algorithm that creates a 100x100 landscape using Pygame. The landscape is generated with a unique approach, aiming to demonstrate the basics of procedural content generation.

# Overview
This project includes a Python script that generates a visual representation of a landscape. Although the landscape is labeled as "procedurally generated," the method used is quite basic. The main purpose of this project is to provide a foundation for exploring more complex procedural generation techniques.

# Features
Generates a 100x100 grid representing a landscape.
Displays the landscape using Pygame.
Easy to run with terminal instructions.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10
Pygame library
You can install Pygame using pip:

```console
pip install pygame
```
# Getting Started
Clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Procedural-Generation.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```console
cd Procedural-Generation
```
Run the script:

```console
python island_procedural_generation.py
```
Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to generate and view the landscape.


# Usage
Once you run the script, it will generate a 100x100 board. You can modify the generation parameters within the script to see how they affect the landscape.
